# Data cleaning

Before we start working with any data, it is important to clean it. Data cleaning can differ from data to data depending on the anomalies and inconsistencies that lie within the data. The sad news is that nothing can be done without cleaning the data, which kind of makes this step primany and significant over all other steps.

# Train Test split

Train test split simply means splitting the data into training and testing data, and as the name suggests training data is fitted inside the desired model to train it and the testing is done thought testing data. We also need to specify a train test ratio for the splitting.

After this step we are left with four values which are as follows.

1.X train

2.X test

3.Y train

4.Y test.

Vectorization.

It is the process of converting data into numbers since machines understand numbers better than anybody. In this file I have performed the count vectorizer. Td-idf vectorizer may also be performed in some cases.
